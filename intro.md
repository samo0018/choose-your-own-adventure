# The Whale in the Sky
Long ago, a big whale lived in the sky. The whale swam in the clouds during the day and would eat the stars at night. Everyone was scared of it, because some said it ate people too. Nobody ever saw it before. 

One day, your mother told you to go to the lake to fill up a bucket of water. As you were walking to the lake, you look up and see the whale above you. It's looking at you.
